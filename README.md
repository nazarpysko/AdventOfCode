# My Advent of Code solutions
Each year is intended to implement AoC solutions in a specific programming language I am trying to learn or improve. 

## 2015: Javascript

## 2022: Go
To create new day: 
``` make
make new day=XX
```

To run a specific day and part, make sure to be in 2022 folder and execute the following:
``` go
go run dayXX/partY.go
```
